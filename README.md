# Hello, brothers! <img src="https://c.tenor.com/Wx9IEmZZXSoAAAAi/hi.gif" width=40px>

My name is Luis Onuma. I'm 26, studying at TUM, and currently doing a research exchange at Stanford. I'm from Mexico, with 100% Japanese roots, and living in Munich since 2014.

You might see me involved in various hackathons coming up in the US (e.g., [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/))

Also, I am looking to collaborate in projects with anyone involved with creator coins :)

### ⛏ My current project

In a collaborative research project between TUM and Stanford, I'm researching the benefits and challenges of independent musicians using creator coins. I was motivated to pursue this topic because I believe in the extremely high potential of creator coins for artists. I imagine that in the future, every successful artist will be also an entrepreneur, with a creator coin that encourages the community development, gives special perks to the coin holders, and functions as a valuable asset.

Also, as I will be looking for interview partners in the indie music industry using creator coins (e.g. [Rally](https://rally.io/)), I would appreciate any leads :)
